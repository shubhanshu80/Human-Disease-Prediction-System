# Human Disease Prediction System Using Symptoms

## Overview

This project is a **machine learning-based application** that predicts diseases based on a user's selected symptoms. The system employs four different algorithms‚Äî**Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Naive Bayes**‚Äîto deliver diverse and reliable predictions. The intuitive user interface is now built with **Streamlit**, offering a seamless and interactive web experience. All prediction results and user data are stored in an **SQLite database** for easy reference and future analysis.

## Features

- **Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Naive Bayes, providing multi-perspective predictions for enhanced reliability.
- **Modern Web Interface:** Built with Streamlit, enabling users to interactively select symptoms, view real-time predictions, and enjoy a responsive web-based experience.
- **Consolidated Predictions:** After running all algorithms, users can click the ‚ÄúFinal Prediction‚Äù button for a consensus result, increasing confidence in the diagnosis.
- **Persistent Data Storage:** Patient information and predictions are stored in SQLite, supporting export and further analysis.
- **Easy-to-Use Workflow:** Streamlined process from symptom selection to result display, suitable for both technical and non-technical users.

## Tech Stack

| Component        | Technology           |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Programming      | Python              |
| GUI              | Streamlit           |
| ML Algorithms    | Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes |
| Database         | SQLite              |
| Development Env. | Jupyter Notebook, VS Code |

## How It Works

1. **Input:**  
   The user enters their name and selects five symptoms from a predefined list.

2. **Prediction:**  
   Upon clicking ‚ÄúPredict All,‚Äù four machine learning models process the symptoms and predict potential diseases.

3. **Final Outcome:**  
   Clicking ‚ÄúFinal Prediction‚Äù displays a consolidated disease prediction, synthesized from all model outputs.

4. **Data Storage:**  
   All patient details (name, symptoms, predictions) are recorded in an SQLite database.
